# urtoken.org

A Vue.js App that secures ERC20/BEP20 tokens by converting them to "primitive" urTokens.
The ERC20 standard greatly improved the user experience when
interacting with Dapps. Dapp users can permit, approve and allow
other users or contracts to transact on their behalf. When a user
gives this access to a malicious contract or user, their funds are
at a risk of being drained.

## More Information
urToken aims to secure your ERC20/BEP20 tokens by "converting"
them to primitive urTokens. For example, USDC will be
"converted" to urUSDC. urUSDC will not allow other users or
contracts to spend your tokens. The functionality of urToken is
very limited. As a user, you can only transfer them to other
users. This means that no user or contract has approval to spend
urtokens. You can swap back and forth. For example, 1 USDC will
be converted to 1 urUSDC and vice versa. There are no fees for
using the service except the usual gas fees.
